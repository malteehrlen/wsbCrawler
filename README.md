# wsbCrawler
a Python script to crawl subreddits and collect stock tickers together with their context.
The data will be stored in a sqlite3 database for use with for instance deep learning algos.
Included is a script to create training datasets easily (you can evaluate comments for 
sentiment analysis)

This is something I wrote for personal use, there is a little fiddliness if you want to use
it yourself (row 18-20 of the evaluation script for instance).
